My project creates AI-generated playlist cover images for Spotify users base don their Spotify playlists. The dependencies are shown in requirements, but i am hosting in GCP so that is doen automatically. To run the project just visit https://playlist-cover-image-gen.uw.r.appspot.com, login to spotify, and select an album to geenrate an image for!

The output will be an image that you can upload to Spotify to have it replace your current playlist cover image. These images can take upo to 2 or 3 minutes to generate and are not always very realistic and they have a pre-defined style, but there is randomness involved so that a playlist will not always produce the same cover.
